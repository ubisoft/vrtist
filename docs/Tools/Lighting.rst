| The lighting tool is used to add lights in the scene. Three different types of lights are available to the user. To add a light, drag the light’s model into the scene.

| Point light adds a light at a point in the scene that projects light in every direction.

| Spot light adds a light at a point in the scene that projects light restricted to an angle.

| Sun light adds a global light in the scene that projects in a single direction.

| Use the panel on the right to select a light already in the scene.
