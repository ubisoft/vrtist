| The camera tool can also be used to create a sequence of shots.
| 
| To create a sequence of shots you will need multiple cameras in the scene.
| Start by creating one camera for each shot. These cameras can be animated if needed.
| Then open the camera panel, and tick the shot Manager checkbox to open the shot manager panel. Opening the Animation editor will help the process.
| 
| Select a camera in the scene, then add it to the shot manager by clicking the |AddIcon| icon.
| Set the start frame of this shot by moving to the desired frame on the timeline, then clicking the left arrow (facing right) on the shot line. Set the end frame of the shot in the same way with the right arrow.
| Repeat this process for each camera used in the montage.
| Select a camera and use the up and down arrow at the top of the panel to reorder it.
| To duplicate a shot, select the shot line, and click the |DuplicateIcon| icon.
| To deactivate a shot, uncheck the box at the beginning.
| To remove a shot, select the line, and click the |RemoveIcon| icon.
| 
| To preview the result, tick the “montage” checkbox, open the Camera preview window in the camera panel and play the timeline.
| The shot manager will go to the first frame of the first shot, play until the last frame of the shot, then jump to the first frame of the next shot to play. This will be repeated for each shot.
| Click the |RecordVideoIcon| icon in the shot manager panel to create and export a video of the result.
